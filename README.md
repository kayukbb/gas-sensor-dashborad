# Gas Sensor Dashboard

## Demo

You can view the live demo of the Gas Sensor Dashboard [here](https://kayukbb.github.io/gas-sensor-dashborad-react/).

## Description

This project is a web application built using **React** and **Vite** for the frontend, along with **Node.js** and **Express.js** for the backend. The purpose of this dashboard is to visualize data from gas sensors.

**Note:** Currently, the Node.js server is not available, so no data will be displayed on the dashboard.

## Features

- Responsive design that works on various devices.
- User-friendly interface to visualize gas sensor data.
- Profile section to learn more about the developer.
